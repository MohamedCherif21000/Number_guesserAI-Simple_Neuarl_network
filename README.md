ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MohamedCherif21000

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Doing New Stuff learn Ai and machine learning algorithms

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning / I am learning, so if I make a mistake, do not take it seriously and ask me to correct my mistakes. I am a beginner programmer with a year and a half of experience in Python, HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript, so I learn more and more every time I make mistakes.

ðŸ“« you can reach me with this email eidros183@gmail.com or on this zidmoh75@gmail.com i will responde as soon i view the messege ...

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: i am positive persone and i will do my best to learn and develope

âš¡ Fun fact: i am Actualy from Algeria So... yeah almost everything here in french and arabic dont blame my english grammer

This is a Number guesseR WHICH USES Keras and transflow neural network machine learning The neural network in this codebase is defined in the create_model method of the GuessApp class. It is a feedforward neural network with one input layer, three hidden layers, and one output layer. The input layer has a shape of (5,) and is connected to a hidden layer with 64 neurons. This hidden layer is connected to another hidden layer with 32 neurons, which is then connected to a final hidden layer with 16 neurons. The output layer has a single neuron.

The neural network is trained using the user's guesses and the AI agent's previous guesses as input and output data, respectively. The goal of the neural network is to learn to predict the user's guess based on the AI agent's previous guesses.

You must install Tkinter library using this Comman : pip install tkinter

You must install numpy Using : pip install numpy

You must install tensorflow Using : pip install tensorflow

You must install json Using : pip install json

if you had any issues Just install keras Using : pip install keras

althought its a part of transflow but some of you have errors like y had :))
